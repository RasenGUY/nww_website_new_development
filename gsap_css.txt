    - Params
    
        - all css properties 
        - special properties (duration, ease)
            - specificic (these are related to scrollTrigger)
        - targets -> these are the elements that are targeted for animations


    - things to consider
        - if you set useBase to true - that means that only the base settings that have been set inline will be used
            - if its set to false and there is a base set inline -> then update the general base settings with the basesettings provided inline (to update base settings of individual animations)
        - if hastrigger is set to true -> only use the scrollTrigger settings provided inline
            - if it set to false but there are scrollTrigger options provided inline then update the scrolltrigger settings
