    - create function for injecting css on given scrollTrigger position
        - custom library based on gsap (partly)
        - Library (gsap css) 
            
            - function
                - create tween animations inline - connects with gsap library - that trigger from the perspective of the inline styled element 
            
            - types of gsap tweens the library can create
                - from (s, m) 
                    - components
                        - targetSel
                        - fromVars -> css properties 
                        - special -> basic settings (duration etc. but it also includes some special settings e.g. scrollTrigger)
                - to (s, m)
                    - components
                        - targetSel
                        - toVars -> css properties 
                        - special -> basic settings (duration etc. but it also includes some special settings e.g. scrollTrigger)
                - fromTo (s, m)
                    - components
                        - targetSel
                        - fromVars -> css properties 
                        - toVars -> css properties + special (base)
                - simple scrollTo animations (specifically for navigation buttons)
                    - components
                        - scrollPerspective (window, costumDomElement)
                        - special settings (e.g. duration, ease etc.)
                        - scrollTo settings
                            - scrollTarget
                            - settings related to scrollTo 
            
            - Params
            
                - all css properties 
                - special properties (duration, ease)
                    - specificic (these are related to scrollTrigger)
                - targets -> these are the elements that are targeted for animations

    - bugs
        - figure a different way to update the nested object 
            - try using lodash -> https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/lodash for deepmerging of things - drawback: dependency on a library 
        - merge the objects first and then change things
        

    - paralax effect for heros
        - scales in or out ? -> check up on some already utilized ways
    - paralax effect for background bubbles 
        - bubbles animation with gradients
        - rotation of the circles
 
- function flow
    - add scrollTo event listeners to targets (list of targets)
    - trigger callback function 
        - in this case the gsap.from() tween
